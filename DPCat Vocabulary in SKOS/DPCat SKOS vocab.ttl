It extends Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 2 and DCAT Application profile for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP) standards and reuses Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) Specification to enable data governance of ROPA and related information across a wide variety of use-cases."@en;

  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "DPCat extends the DCAT Application profile for data portals in Europe< (DCAT-AP) with concepts identified in CSM-ROPA using DPV to enable representation of ROPA and associated information as ’catalogues’ and ’datasets’ respectively, that can be recorded and exchanged between stakeholders. DCAT-AP is a profile of the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT v2) - a W3C standard for facilitating interoperability between data catalogues. DPCat maintains compatibility with DCAT-AP, and through it with DCAT, thereby enabling it to be used in all catalogue-based information management tools and data portals that support DCAT. In particular, the choice of DCAT-AP was made to present a mechanism for sharing ROPA related information using an EU-advocated standard and to promote the possibility of reusing existing data portal infrastructures for compliance-related purposes - such as requirements for ROPA between controllers, processors, and DPAs."@en;
